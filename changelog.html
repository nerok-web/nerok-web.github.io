            Tidy up the code, removed unnecessary files!
            <br>
            Changed navigation bar
            <br>
            Many parts of the site have been updated, several animations have been added!
            <br>
            Remade the entire site <a href="#"style="color: #fff;">Windows Tester</a>

            <br>
            I switched to another hosting, now my site is hosted on github (clear from the url link). The nerok.ml domain is now a redirect to this site.
            <br>
            A LOT of changes, both small and big. Thanks <a href="https://wt-ul.ml/" style="color: #fff;">Windows Tester</a> for helping on Website!

            25.11.2022
	        <br>
	        Added more function, more files on CDN!
	        <br>
	        Russian and old version of the website is available! --> ru.nerok.ml / old.nerok.ml (Not available now)
	        <br><br>
	        02.11.2022
	        <br>
	        The site now freely walks outside the Runet! (сорян ребят, но теперь сайт не на русском)
	        <br>
	        Updated site design (again...)
	        <br>
	        Small alt<s>е</s>rations
	        <br><br>
	        06.07.2022
	        <br>
	        Small improvements.
	        <br>
	        The plans are to create an additional site for this site, so that there would be more menus, that is, many functions that do not fit here were on the second site.
	        <br><br>
	        04.07.2022
	        <br>
	        Wow, for a long time there was no site update ... Catch the update =)
	        <br>
	        Updated completely (again) the design of the site. Thanks NobootRecord for design =)
	        <br><br>
	        05.06.2022
	        <br>
	        The problem that it is impossible to open the tab "Useful programs" is solved. But so far, it works a little buggy.
	        <br>
	        Permissions updated (No longer nerokworld.github.io but nerok.ml). Added a partner - ErtorWorld, and a Telegram channel (which is a long time ago, but still, the link is below;) ).
	        <br>
	        The images are finally working, they can be downloaded! Soon, the list will be replenished - and replenished.
	        <br><br>

	        Thank you so much Maydisiel for helping with the redesign! At the very bottom of the site, there is his site, I advise you to look at it!
	        <br>
	        Complete redesign, transition from yellow-light yellow to black-white. It was pleasing to the eyes. Animations appeared when hovering over an element with the mouse (for example, hover over the "Linux" tab) 
	        <br>
	        So far, the section with useful programs is not working. We will fix this bug soon.
	        <br>
	        Installed DDOS protection, which is important. Now the site is not nerokworld.github.io, but just nerok.ml. In principle, a short domain that everyone can remember, and can write quickly ;)
